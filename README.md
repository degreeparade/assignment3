# Factorial 
This Python program defines a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.  
The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

## Features
- Implements factorial using  loop version
- Returns the calculated factorial.
- Demonstrates usage by calling the function with a sample number (`5`).

task2




This Python program asks the user to input a number and uses Python's built-in `math` module to perform three operations:
1. Square root of the number
2. Natural logarithm (log base e)
3. Sine of the number (in radians)

## Features
- Accepts user input.
- Uses `math.sqrt()`, `math.log()`, and `math.sin()` functions.
- Displays results clearly.
